**Range's highlights:**
 - Streams of records data aggregation system
 - Available as embedded for stand-alone and distributed environments
 - Streams size-tolerant storage
 - Supports hundreds of thousands streams
 - Destigned to be an secured data storage

## Embedding range as stand-alone stream storage 
## Building range server
## Connecting to the range server
